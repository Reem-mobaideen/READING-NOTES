 # <h1>Javascript Operators</h1>


JavaScript includes operators as in other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. + operator adds two numeric values and produces a result which is 3 in this case.

 ## <h2>Comparison Operators</h2>

Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result:

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
Given that x = 6 and y = 3, the table below explains the logical operators:

Some examples:
const a = 3, b = 2;

// less than operator
console.log(a < 2); // false
console.log(b < 3); // true

onst a = true, b = false;
const c = 4;

// logical AND
console.log(a && a); // true
console.log(a && b);  // false

console.log((c > 2) && (c < 2)); // false
