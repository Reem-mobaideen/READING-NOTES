Creating Links in HTML

A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another. Links allow users to move seamlessly from one page to another.

Links are specified in HTML using the <a> tag. The href attribute specifies the target of the link. Its value can be an absolute or relative URL.
Anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag becomes the part of the link that the user sees and clicks in a browser.

Example: <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google Search</a>
