# CSS Layout
The main way to achieve CSS layout is by putting values for all display property. CSS behave separately  with each element in HTML.  The most important element in CSS that affect the shape of page:

# • Position element:
 Positioning permit us  to take elements out of the main  document layout flow, and behave in a different way; such as set the element in the top of one another or any another position. And the position element has different scheme:

1.	Normal flow: the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you have not changed their layout (i.e : which elements are placed inside the browser's viewport.

2.	Relative position: If you set this scheme on an element but no other positioning attributes (top, left, bottom or right), it will have no effect on it’s positioning at all.

3.	Absolute position: This is a very powerful type of positioning that allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it. You use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom, and right to set the location.

4.	Fixed position: This means that you can create useful UI items that are fixed in place, like persisting navigation menus that are always visible no matter how much the page scrolls.

5.	Float element: The float element allow web developers to implement simple layouts involving an image floating inside a column of text, with the text wrapping around the left or right of it.


# •	Containing element:
 it accurse when such  block-level element be inside another block-level element. A group of elements inside <div> element.
