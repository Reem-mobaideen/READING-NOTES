# CSS Layout
### Positions using float property
The float property allow us:
1.	 to put the element in normal flow, as far to the left or right of the containing element. (eg: float:right)
2.	To put elements side by side. When elements are floated, the height of the boxes can affect where the following elements sit.
3.	Creating multiple column layout: by using div tag to represent each column.

# Multiple Style Sheets
Many web pages divided into separate style sheet to control color , font ,â€¦etc. Two ways to add multiple style :
1.	HTML page can link to one style sheet and import rule to  other style sheets. 
2.	 In the HTML you can use a separate element for each style sheet.
